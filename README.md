# Chaos
This application will be something simiar to my [SteamChatBot](https://github.com/dragonbanshee/SteamChatBot), where a user will be able to create a bot controller for adding triggers and such. For use in a Discord server.

SteamChatBot uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the interface, but Chaos will use UWP (Universal Windows Platform). In my opinion this looks much better than WPF and more modern, which is why I am using it instead.


Below will be a timeline of the project, starting with the day I created the solution on Visual Studio.



__February 15, 2017__ - Started project

__February 17, 2017__ - Created GitHub repository

__February 26, 2017__ - Make first code commit with 2 working triggers (KickTrigger and DoormatTrigger)
